**What is Capex?**

Capex is an acronym for Capital Expenditure. In simple terms, it means the expenses incurred by a new business even before it can generate earnings. 
An apt example of Capex for a tech-based business would be purchasing servers.

* Before the cloud came into the picture, companies had to purchase and set up their own servers. 
These servers cost a lot and had to be kept running 24*7 even when they were not in use. 
To keep the servers running, businesses had to invest in good-quality air conditioning, power backups, and IT experts. 
This was a lot of expense to incur and caused a huge loss in case the business failed and had to shut down.

* Capex was considerably brought down by the cloud where you only pay for the amount of services you use. This is well known as the 'Pay as you Go' model. 
AWS is the first cloud provider which came into the market and enjoyed the market monopoly for quite some time. 

**What is Opex?**
Opex is an acronym for Operational Expenditure. It is the expense incurred every month/year to keep the business running. 
Simple examples would be electricity bills, premises rent, and employee salaries.
