# Dockerfile creation using Dockerfile
**Dockerfile**
- It is a text file which contains a set of instructions
- Automates the process of docker image creation
**FROM**
- This is the first line of a Dockerfile and is used for mentioning the name of the base image.
**RUN**
- Runs a command. This creates a new layer in the image.
- Executes commands before container creation.
**MAINTAINER**
- Author/Owner/Description
**COPY**
- Copies files from the local system. A source and a destination need to provided in this command.
[NOTE]
We can't download the file from the internet or from any other remote repo. It should exist in the local system.
**ADD**
- It is similar to the copy command. However, it also provides a feature to download files from the internet. We can also extract images from the docker image site.
**EXPOSE**
- It exposes different ports which are required to run different applications. Example, exposing port 8080 for Tomcat, port 80 for Nginx, etc.
**WORKDIR**
- Sets a Working Directory for Docker a Containers
**CMD**
- Executes commands during container creation
**ENTRYPOINT**
- It's function is same as CMD. However, it has a higher level of priority than CMD. Hence, the first commands are run by ENTRYPOINT.
**ENV**
- Environment variables
**ARG**
- Defines the name of a parameter and its value.
- The main difference between ENV and ARG is that, we are not able to access ARG later while running the docker container.
