# Creation of Dockerfile

**Steps**
1. Create a file named Dockerfile
2. List down the instructions that need to be executed within the Dockerfile
3. Build the Dockerfile and create an image.
4. Run the newly created image to create a container.

Create the Dockerfile
```
vi Dockerfile
```
```
FROM ubuntu
RUN echo "Creating our Image" > tmp/testfile
```
To create an image out of docker file
```
docker build -t image-name .
```
[!NOTE]
-t stands for tagname, .(dot) stands for the current directory.

Check process state
```
docker ps -a
```
View Images
```
docker images
```
Create container from the above image
```
docker run -it --name container-name image-name /bin/bash
```
Demo commands for the next image creation. We can write this in the existing Dockerfile instead of creating a new one.

1. Create a testfile, test and test.tar.gz
2. Build the image
3. Create the image
```
vi Dockerfile
```
```
FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /tmp
RUN echo "Hello World" > /tmp/testfile
ENV myname Devops
COPY testfile /tmp
ADD test.tar.gz /tmp
```
