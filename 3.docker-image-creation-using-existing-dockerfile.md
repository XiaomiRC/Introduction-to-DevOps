# Docker image creation using existing Dockerfile

1. We have to first create a container from our image:
```
docker run -it --name container-name image-name /bin/bash
```
2. Inside directory to create a file
```
cd tmp/
```
3. Create a file inside tmp directory
```
touch myfile
```
4. View the difference between the base image and the changes made on it
We can use the tags D for Deletion, C for Change and A for Append/Addition
```
docker diff old-container-name
```
5. Create an image of this container
```
docker commit container-name container-image-name
```
6. View the image that's been just created
```
docker images
```
7. Now create a container from this image
```
docker run -it --name container-name updated-image-name /bin/bash
ls
cd tmp/
lso/p
myfile
```
You will get all the files back
